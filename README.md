# modest-proposal

A *slow* burning muse about nuclear power generation.

## Goals ##

- Ascertain whether nuclear power generation can make a *sustainable* contribution to the UK's projected electricity
  demand.
- Minimise the demands on long term geological storage of nuclear waste products.
- Make it impossible to subvert or hijack resources for weapon use.
- Do something useful about the roughly 113 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting around the UK.
- Do something useful about the roughly 6000 tonnes of actinides sitting around the UK in the form of spent nuclear
  fuel, not to mention another 1000 tonnes coming our way from current activities.
- Learn a few things in the process.

## Sustainable? ##

- Well, not forever, but please bear in mind that renewable power technologies such as wind, solar or hydroelectric
  power rely ultimately on the Sun's nuclear fusion process; the Sun will eventually go nova and fizzle out.
- So, for at least 1000 years. Long enough for someone to build *a workable power plant* using deuterium-tritium fusion,
  followed by either deuterium-deuterium fusion or hydrogen-boron fusion for when the lithium runs out. These are not
  easy things to do. The author doubts he will see this in his lifetime, but is open to being pleasantly surprised.

## Why the UK? ##

It's where I live. Just down the road from all that lovely plutonium, as it turns out!

## Shouldn't we just ban nuclear power? ##

Uh-huh...

I disagree, and I suspect if you don't like nuclear power, you probably also don't like wind turbines, solar panels,
hydroelectric dams, pylons, EVs, trains, buses or anything else that isn't just the status quo of burning fossil fuels
and burying your head in the sand.

The thing is, even if you secretly adore fossil fuels (let's be honest, most people do deep down, 'green' rhetoric
notwithstanding), the world is going to run out of fossil fuels; we're talking about within a century. **You**
may not experience their demise, but your *children and grandchildren* will.

So even if you insist on denying the effect of increasing carbon dioxide on the atmosphere, or think that carbon-capture
or geo-engineering via sulphur dioxide will allow us to conduct business as usual, we're going to have to do something
to keep the lights on.

Waiting until the end of fossil fuels isn't a great time to start doing the research-and-development on alternative
energy supplies. Setting stuff up requires a working technological infrastructure, one that consumes a lot of power. You
can't start a fusion reactor with a team of heavy horses. You can't extract rare earths with burning cow-pat.

Still avid about banning nuclear? OK, let's have it your way - what do you intend to do about all that plutonium then?
Just saying that it's banned won't make it disappear. *Naughty plutonium, begone! Get thee behind me, spent nuclear
fuel!* This thing called chemistry is based on the fact that atomic nuclei hang around, despite both biological and
artificial means of recombining these nuclei in inventive ways to make new substances. We can hide our plutonium nuclei
in ceramic plutonium dioxide, or as an insoluble mineral plutonium trifluoride, or dissolve it as plutonium nitrate, or
even make an alloy out of it with gallium, but it's still there.

So it just sits around above ground, gathering dust - and requires a lot of money to look after it and stop
unwholesome people from getting their hands on it.

Ironically, if you hate plutonium, the best way to get rid of it is to fission it - that really does change those pesky
atomic nuclei. You get some electrical power into the bargain too. Quite a lot of it.

## The Pipe-dream ##

First things first - this is just a fanciful idea right now. What I'm interested in is finding out whether the goals
above could be achieved from a physics standpoint. I'm not about to roll up my sleeves and build something in my
backyard.

Some people do fantasy football, I'm doing fantasy nuclear power.

So let's set out the store...

- We have a reactor, because that's where plutonium gets fissioned (or just plain 'burnt' if we're being less formal
  about terminology), and that's what gives us electrical power.
- We have a fuel cycle, because we want to do something with the existing spent nuclear fuel from the current UK nuclear
  power plant fleet, as well as new stuff that is being built (the EPR reactors) and I hope will be built (the SMR
  reactors).
- We also have the fuel cycle because we need to do something with the stuff going through our special reactor being
  discussed here.
- We have a geological disposal facility because ultimately we have to do something with the genuine nuclear waste
  that comes out of the fuel cycle.

## Some background information ##

Now, when I say *'genuine nuclear waste'*, I don't mean the spent nuclear fuel coming out of the existing reactor fleet,
or our special reactor. I mean the fission products that result from the reactors doing their thing and producing
electricity, as well as some troublemaker elements called the 'minor actinides' that are generated as a byproduct. Also
included is 'fuel cladding', namely the metal sheath that goes around the actual nuclear fuel to hold it together
inside the reactor in the form of a fuel rod, keeping it isolated from the external environment. There are also various
structural bits of metal used to tie the fuel rods together into what is called an 'assembly'.

So spent nuclear fuel is in reality an entire assembly, containing the actual nuclear fuel, the cladding and the
structural bits. An awful lot of that is potentially recyclable into a new generation of assemblies that can go back
into a reactor. However, that isn't done these days in the UK - we just store the used assemblies above ground in secure
buildings, or sometimes leave them hanging around in old reactors.

The fission products contribute a few percent of the spent fuel's mass - typically around 3 to 5% of the mass of
uranium used to make the fresh lot of fuel. Very little uranium actually gets fissioned in most reactors!

The minor actinides come in at around less than 1% of that mass of uranium.

There's roughly a percent of plutonium too.

So more than 90% of the original uranium can be recycled.

The cladding and structural bits contribute very roughly about a quarter of the mass of the entire fuel assembly.

It depends on the kind of cladding used, but in many cases it too could be recycled - but that isn't happening anywhere
right now. The structural bits aren't recyclable at all.

The thing to bear in mind here is that by recycling the uranium and plutonium, as well as the cladding where possible,
we can avoid putting so much stuff into a geological repository.

I mentioned above that 'Very little uranium actually gets fissioned'. This is down to two concerns, the first is that
there is a technological limit as to how long a fuel rod can stay in use within a reactor. The cladding and structural
materials suffer a very slow process of wearing out due to the irradiation and heat inside the reactor, and so does the
fuel itself to a lesser extent. Rather than take it to the absolute limit, the utilities play it safe and limit the
exposure (or 'burnup' in the jargon) of the fuel rods. So more uranium and plutonium could be burnt, but isn't to keep
things safe.

The second concern is that in order to get a nuclear reactor going, there needs to be a concentration of 'fissile'
isotopes in the fuel. All uranium can be fissioned one way or another, but to keep the process going, there needs to be
more than a minimal fraction of the fissile isotopes. These can be U-235, which occurs naturally in mined uranium, or
Pu-239 or Pu-241, which are completely synthetic. There is also U-233 as well, and that is also completely synthetic.

The uranium mined out of the Earth only contains a trifling 0.7% by mass of U-235; the rest is U-238, and you can't
*start* a reactor with that, although you can burn it a little bit once the reactor gets going. So a lot of mined
uranium is run through an 'enrichment plant' to yield a small amount of enriched uranium with around 3% to 5% U-235,
plus a whopping pile of 'depleted uranium' that is almost entirely U-238. That small amount of enriched uranium becomes
fresh nuclear fuel, and the whopping pile of depleted uranium, um ... sits around gathering dust.

Now, depleted uranium is pretty harmless stuff, but it's currently the end of the line, essentially it's a glorified
spoil heap.

It is hard work getting the enrichment all the way from 0.7% up to even a measly 5%, so most of the time enrichment
stops there - and that's why burn-up is limited; once the U-235 concentration gets to around 1%, there just isn't enough
of the vital ingredient to keep the reactor going. What's more, once the enrichment in U-235 goes above 20%, this is
taken to be an indication that someone is trying to go for higher enrichment - up to more than 90% - to build a nuclear
weapon, and this is considered to be a **Bad Thing**.

Recycling spent nuclear fuel (in the jargon, 'reprocessing') can help address these two concerns.

The first is circumvented because the recycled fuel is reconstituted anew with fresh cladding - so it is ready for more
punishment in the reactor.

The second is circumvented because while the U-235 (and some of the U-238) is being fissioned, some more of the U-238 is
transformed in the fuel rod into Pu-239 - and that is fissile. Because the U-238 gives rise to fissile Pu-239, it is
termed 'fertile' and the process is called 'breeding'. This is a good thing, because some of that Pu-239 also
fissions and that increases the burn-up time for a fuel rod, so we get power for a longer period for free.

Now, in a perfect world, reprocessing would allow the remaining dregs of the U-235 to join forces with the Pu-239 bred
in the reactor that hasn't yet been burnt, and that would result in enough fissile concentration to start up a reactor,
so we could keep going for quite a few cycles before all the majority U-238 is either fissioned or converted into
Pu-239.

The catch is that breeding isn't very effective - so for every 100 U-235 nuclei that are fissioned, it turns out around
only 60 to 80 new nuclei of Pu-239 are born from U-238, it depends on the reactor type. Some of these Pu-239 nuclei are
in turn fissioned, so by the time a spent fuel rod comes out of a reactor, it's down to around 1% U-235 and around 1%
Pu. That will only allow a single extra go around in the reactor, and a short one at that.

## Enter the breeder reactor ##

I'm not going into detail here, but it is possible (and it has been done) to build a reactor that can create as much
Pu-239 as it is consumes in fissile nuclei. The idea is to burn Pu-239 as the fissile material in fuel rods, and do the
breeding in a separate volume of U-238 called a 'breeding blanket', away from the 'core' where the power is generated.
The core fuel rods are a mix of depleted uranium (so just U-238) and plutonium (actually a mix of Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241
and Pu-242 - this is because breeding always overshoots a little, some of the Pu-239 itself gets converted over time to
Pu-240 and so on). The blanket is just depleted uranium.

This requires a much higher level of fissile enrichment in the core, say around 20% (can be lower or higher, it
depends). It also means that reprocessing has to be tweaked, so that the plutonium being bred in the blanket is
transferred into the next cycle's core along with all the plutonium from the previous cycle's core). Essentially, each
lot of reprocessing sucks up the plutonium bred in the blanket and adds it to the stash of the next cycle's core,
keeping the enrichment high enough to restart the reactor.

This is fantastic news, because we don't have to mine every last bit of uranium to get at those precious U-235 nuclei
via enrichment. Instead, we can take that pile of depleted uranium spoil from the enrichment people and put it into the
breeding blanket, and keep our breeder reactor going for a long time.

About 1000 years, give or take.

## Purex ##

Naturally, there's a new catch to this marvellous scheme - and that is in the detail 'reprocessing sucks up the
plutonium bred in the blanket'. The implication is that plutonium has to be *separated* from the remaining U-238 via a
chemical process called 'Purex'; that makes some folk uneasy, because that means we have something that is very enriched
in Pu-239 and Pu-241, both of which are fissile, and that makes us think of nuclear weapons again.

Incidentally, the fission products and minor actinides are also separated out from both the uranium and the plutonium,
which is good as they are part of the genuine waste.

A bit more on Purex - this was done in the US and the UK, but abandoned in the US in the 1970s because of those uneasy
feelings, and abandoned in the UK because natural gas was hitting its stride in the 1980s, which led to the government
pulling the plug on breeder reactor development, eventually leading to the final termination of the last Purex
reprocessing plant in the UK in 2022. We're past peak natural gas production in the North Sea fields, so that decision
doesn't seem quite such a good idea these days.

France continues to use Purex, but they start with spent fuel from ordinary reactors and put their plutonium back into
them for one or two more cycles. After these, the plutonium is considered to be junk and can't be reused in an ordinary
reactor - although it *could* go into a breeder reactor, so it's a limited, stop-gap form of recycling (it's down to
those non-fissile isotopes of plutonium, Pu-240 and Pu-242 - they build up through the cycles and spoil things).

Other countries are building and experimenting with their own new breeder reactors and Purex plants.

To summarise, Purex takes plutonium and separates it out from uranium. Because the uranium is practically all U-238,
that means that we're concentrating the fissile isotopes Pu-239 and Pu-241, and thus we can build a new batch of nuclear
fuel from that concentrate. That can be diluted down to 20% or so to make new fuel for a breeder reactor core, or can be
diluted all the way down to around 7% to make new fuel for an ordinary reactor, which is the French way of doing things.

## The key idea ##

OK - breeder reactors are cool, but we worry about Purex and nuclear weapons.

What if there were *two* fertile isotopes that we bred fissile isotopes from? Could we run this through a tweaked
reprocessing and only separate the fissile isotopes from just one of the fertile isotopes? If we did, we'd have a
concentrate of fissile isotopes, but still too dilute to use in a weapon because of the remaining fertile isotope.

So, we have U-238 as one fertile isotope, and let's introduce the isotope of thorium, Th-232 as the other. Mined thorium
is to all intents and purposes just this isotope, and it breeds U-233, which like Pu-239 and Pu-241 is a synthetic
fissile isotope.

So if we have a mixture of U-238 and Th-232, we'll end up with a mix of Pu-239 and U-233 as fissile isotopes; by
separating both uranium and plutonium together away from thorium, we can achieve a partial concentration of the fissile
isotopes, but keeping lots of U-238 in the concentrate to make it useless in weapons.

(Actually, due to breeding overshooting, we'll get Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241, Pu-242, U-233, U-234 and U-235, so there are
actually four fissile isotopes in play here, the ones with odd-numbers. Nonetheless, it is Pu-239 and U-233 that play
the lead roles.)

## Putting it together ##

Let's start with the spent nuclear fuel from the UK's existing fleet. This is actually a mixture of oxides, mostly
uranium dioxide (UO2) with some plutonium dioxide (PuO2), various fission product oxides, the minor actinides in oxide
form and some fission product elements that stay in elemental form, either as metals or gases.

This spent fuel can be subject to 'voloxidation', which is a very rough-and-ready form of reprocessing that breaks up
the spent fuel (which is a brittle fused ceramic) into a fine powder. Unlike Purex, very little gets separated out here,
just a couple of fission products. The crucial point is that the spent fuel is rendered ready for refabrication by
powdering it. This is done by blending it very finely with thorium dioxide (ThO2), pressing the blend into compacts and
firing them to make new ceramic pellets for the breeding blanket. So that's the spent fuel from the existing reactor
fleet dealt with - it goes into our special reactor's breeding blanket.

The core fuel is what we get when we reprocess a combination of our special reactor's core fuel and breeding blanket
from the previous cycle - we separate the uranium + plutonium as a mixed concentrate with all the fissile isotopes in
it, leaving the thorium behind, and also separating out the fission products and minor actinides, just as Purex does.

This gives us a blend of UO2 and PuO2, for the core fuel, and leaves Th02 for recycling into the next cycle's breeding
blanket.

In terms of physical and chemical properties, the core fuel is the same as the core fuels already tried out in past and
current breeder reactors that use the Purex approach for reprocessing. The only difference is that the fissile
enrichment is now split between Pu-239 and Pu-241 on the one hand and U-233 and U-235 on the other.

There is a flow to how material moves through the cycles:

- We have incoming spent nuclear fuel from the existing reactor fleet that goes to making the breeding blanket by
  voloxidation and combination with ThO2.
- Spent nuclear fuel from the special reactor goes into reprocessing to separate out fission products, ThO2 for
  recycling back into the breeding blanket and a UO2+PuO2 blend that makes fresh core fuel.
- There is a shuffle of material going on from one cycle to the next both in the reactor and through reprocessing.

That shuffle serves several purposes:

1. It is necessary to move fuel rods from outer areas of the reactor towards the center as the fuel is burned up -
   nuclear reactions take place more frequently towards the centre, so as the fuel is burned out, it gets a boost from
   being moved inwards, and that keeps the heating profile in the reactor more evenly balanced, as well as burning the
   fuel down more efficiently.
2. On the third shuffle, a fuel rod is removed from the reactor and sent for reprocessing in batches. The new fuel rods
   that arise from this reprocessing contain more core fuel, because each time reprocessing is done, it picks up U02 and
   PuO2 from the previous cycle's blanket.
3. There are three lots of reprocessing done during the full round of shuffling - in the final one, the UO2+PuO2 blend
   is *not* used to make new core fuel, rather it becomes replacement fuel for the existing reactor fleet.

Looking at this more closely, we start the shuffle with a rod that is made only of breeding blanket pellets - these are
60% Th02 and 40% voloxidized spent nuclear fuel from the fleet, so around a 3:2 ratio of Th02 versus UO2.

This goes into the special reactor on the outermost perimeter (looking down from the top), serving as what is called
the 'radial breeding blanket' in the jargon. It's not really a fuel rod at all, because all the pellets are breeding
blanket ones - although there is a little plutonium in it already, because it is spent fuel.

The rod accumulates some more fissile isotopes, and is shuffled further in...

... and again, afterwards it is shuffled out of the reactor for reprocessing.

Reprocessing results in that 40% of the original rod forming core fuel in the fresh fuel rod (now it's got some
concentrated fissile isotopes, so it's the real thing), the remaining 60% is filled with blanket pellets on the bottom
and top, serving as what is called the 'axial breeding blanket' in the jargon. Back in it goes, this time further in
towards the centre of the reactor...

The rod burns some fissile isotopes in the core part, and accumulates some in the axial breeding blanket parts, and is
shuffled right into the centre...

... and again, afterwards it is shuffled out of the reactor for reprocessing.

Now reprocessing adds another 24% of core fuel to make a new fuel rod with 64% core pellets and 36% axial breeder
blanket pellets. Back in it goes for the final bout of shuffling towards the centre, but this time in an intermediate
zone outside the central part and inside the radial breeding blanket.

After two passes of shuffling through and out of the reactor, there is a final reprocessing that results in UO2 + PuO2
fuel pellets that can be used by the reactor fleet.

Because we start with breeding blanket pellets in a 3:2 proportion of thorium to uranium and recycle the thorium, this
has the effect of enriching the fissile isotopes by a factor of 2.5 during the initial reprocessing. The next
reprocessing doesn't enrich so much, because the previous core fuel has burnt out somewhat, and there are fewer breeding
blanket pellets to abstract fissile material from. The final reprocessing has even fewer breeding blanket pellets to
work with, so it can't really top up the enrichment at all - the majority of the fuel rod is made of core pellets that
have burnt up. So we'd expect the fissile enrichment to go up initially on the first reprocessing, flatten off on the
next and then drop down on the final reprocessing.

## Starting it all up ##

This description is all very well, but to start with we won't have fuel pellets because we haven't done any reprocessing
yet, because we haven't got any spent fuel pellets, because...

To get out of this chicken-and-egg situation, we take the existing stockpile of UK plutonium, in the form of PuO2, and
blend it with depleted UO2 to make stand-in core pellets, using the same process as for making blanket pellets in a
special run. So it is Pu-239 and Pu-241 that take on all the responsibility for fissile enrichment. In an ideal world,
this would be frowned upon because we don't want to have separated plutonium in the first place, but remember, this
stuff already exists; we're trying to do something about it.

This mixing of PuO2 is also done on the first batches of reprocessed UO2+PuO2 that are recycled as core fuel pellets,
because those from the first few shuffles out of the reactor will lack sufficient fissile isotopes bred in the blanket
pellets; the distribution of fissile isotopes across the shuffles has to settle down into an equilibrium.

## Mission Statement ##

So the questions arise:

1. What do the numbers look like in reality - how much electrical power does the reactor yield?
2. Is there enough enrichment to make the reactor go?
3. What would be the final enrichment of the fuel intended for the external reactor fleet?
4. How much material could be processed in this way?
5. How much of the existing plutonium to we need to bootstrap the cycle? Is there enough at all, or for just one special
   reactor, or could we do this more than once?
6. How long between shuffles?

There are plenty of other questions to ask, such as:

1. What is the reactor design?
2. What cladding is used for the fuel?
3. How does the reprocessing work for the new combinations of materials in the fuel rod?
4. What can be done about recycling cladding from the existing reactor fleet?

If you're reading this and it's piqued your interest, feel free to take a look yourself - it might make a good project
for a PhD. If I get anywhere, it would be nice to compare results. :smile:
