A *slow* burning muse about nuclear power generation.

## Goals ##

- Find a way that nuclear power generation can make a *sustainable* contribution to the UK's projected electricity demand.
- Minimise the demands on long term geological storage of nuclear waste products.
- Make it impossible to subvert or hijack resources for weapon use.
- Do something useful about the roughly 113 tonnes of plutonium sitting around the UK.
- Do something useful about the roughly 4400 tonnes of actinides sitting around the UK in the form of spent nuclear fuel, not to mention another 1000 tonnes coming our way from current activities.
- Learn a few things in the process.

## Sustainable? ##
