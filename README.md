# modest-proposal

A *slow* burning muse about nuclear power generation.

## Goals ##

- Find a way that nuclear power generation can make a *sustainable* contribution to the UK's projected electricity
  demand.
- Minimise the demands on long term geological storage of nuclear waste products.
- Make it impossible to subvert or hijack resources for weapon use.
- Do something useful about the roughly 113 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting around the UK.
- Do something useful about the roughly 6000 tonnes of actinides sitting around the UK in the form of spent nuclear
  fuel, not to mention another 1000 tonnes coming our way from current activities.
- Learn a few things in the process.

## Sustainable? ##

- Well, not forever, but please bear in mind that renewable power technologies such as wind, solar or hydroelectric
  power rely ultimately on the Sun's nuclear fusion process; the Sun will eventually go nova and fizzle out.
- So, for at least 1000 years. Long enough for someone to build *a workable power plant* using deuterium-tritium fusion,
  followed by either deuterium-deuterium fusion or hydrogen-boron fusion for when the lithium runs out. These are not
  easy things to do! The author doubts he will see this in his lifetime, but is open to being pleasantly surprised.

## Why the UK? ##

It's where I live. Just down the road from all that lovely plutonium, as it turns out!

## Shouldn't we just ban nuclear power? ##

Uh-huh...

I disagree, and I suspect if you don't like nuclear power, you probably also don't like wind turbines, solar panels,
hydroelectric dams, pylons, EVs, trains, buses or anything else that isn't just the status quo of burning fossil fuels
and burying your head in the sand.

The thing is, even if you secretly adore fossil fuels (let's be honest, most people do deep down, 'green' rhetoric
notwithstanding), the world is going to run out of fossil fuels, and we're talking about within a century. **You**
may not experience their demise, but your *children and grandchildren* will.

So even if you insist on denying the effect of increasing carbon dioxide on the atmosphere, or think that carbon-capture
or geo-engineering via sulphur dioxide will allow us to conduct business as usual, we're going to have to do something
to keep the lights on.

Waiting until the end of fossil fuels isn't a great time to start doing the research-and-development on alternative
energy supplies. Setting stuff up requires a working technological infrastructure, one that consumes a lot of power. You
can't start a fusion reactor with a team of heavy horses. You can't extract rare earths with burning cow-pat.

Still avid about banning nuclear? OK, let's have it your way - what do you intend to do about all that plutonium then?
Just saying that it's banned won't make it disappear. *Naughty plutonium, begone! Get thee behind me, spent nuclear
fuel!* Nope, there is a thing called chemistry that is based on the fact that atomic nuclei hang around, despite both
biology and artificial means of recombining these nuclei in inventive ways to make new substances.

So it's just sitting around above ground, gathering dust - and requiring a lot of money to look after it and stop
unwholesome people from getting their hands on it.

Ironically, if you hate plutonium, the best way to get rid of it is to fission it - that really does change those pesky
atomic nuclei. You get some electrical power into the bargain too. Quite a lot of it.

## The Pipe-dream ##

First things first - this is just a fanciful idea right now. What I'm interested in is finding out whether the goals
above could be achieved from a physics standpoint. I'm not about to roll up my sleeves and build something in my
backyard.

So let's set out the store...

- We have a reactor, because that's where plutonium gets fissioned (or just plain 'burnt' if we're being less formal
  about terminology), and that's what gives us electrical power.
- We have a fuel cycle, because we want to do something with the existing spent nuclear fuel from the current UK nuclear
  power plant fleet, as well as new stuff that is being built (the EPR reactors) and I hope will be built (the SMR
  reactors).
- We also have a fuel cycle because we need to do something with the stuff going through our special reactor being
  discussed here.
- We have a geological disposal facility because ultimately we have to do something with the genuine nuclear waste
  that comes out of the fuel cycle.

Now, when I say *'genuine nuclear waste'*, I don't mean the spent nuclear fuel coming out of the existing reactor fleet,
or our special reactor. I mean the fission products that result from the reactors doing their thing and producing
electricity, as well as some troublemaker elements called the 'minor actinides' that are generated as a byproduct. Also
included are irradiated bits of reactor and what is termed 'fuel cladding', namely the metal sheath that goes around the
real nuclear fuel to hold it together inside the reactor and to stop it contaminating the surroundings when it comes out
of the reactor. There are also various structural bits of metal used to tie the fuel rods together into what is called
an 'assembly'.

So spent nuclear fuel is in reality an entire assembly, containing the actual nuclear fuel, the cladding and the
structural bits. An awful lot of that is potentially recyclable into a new generation of assemblies that can go back
into a reactor. However, that isn't done these days in the UK - we just store the used assemblies above ground in secure
buildings, or sometimes leave them hanging around in old reactors.

The fission products contribute a few percent of the spent fuel's mass - typically around 3 to 5% of the mass of
uranium used to make the fresh lot of fuel. Very little uranium actually gets fissioned in most reactors!

The minor actinides come in at around less than 1% of that mass of uranium.

There's roughly a percent or two or plutonium too.

So more than 90% of the original uranium can be recycled.

The cladding and structural bits contribute very roughly about a quarter of the mass of the entire fuel assembly.

It depends on the kind of cladding used, but in many cases it too could be recycled - but that isn't happening anywhere
right now. The structural bits aren't recyclable at all.

The thing to bear in mind here is that by recycling the uranium and plutonium, as well as the cladding where possible,
we can avoid putting quite so much stuff into a geological repository.
