# modest-proposal

A *slow* burning muse about nuclear power generation.

## Goals ##

- Ascertain whether nuclear power generation can make a *sustainable* contribution to the UK's projected electricity
  demand.
- Minimise the demands on long term geological storage of nuclear waste products.
- Make it impossible to subvert or hijack resources for weapon use.
- Do something useful about the roughly 113 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting around the UK.
- Do something useful about the roughly 6000 tonnes of actinides sitting around the UK in the form of spent nuclear
  fuel, not to mention another 1000 tonnes coming our way from current activities.
- Learn a few things in the process.

## Sustainable? ##

- Well, not forever, but please bear in mind that renewable power technologies such as wind, solar or hydroelectric
  power rely ultimately on the Sun's nuclear fusion process; the Sun will eventually go nova and fizzle out.
- So, for at least 1000 years. Long enough for someone to build *a workable power plant* using deuterium-tritium fusion,
  followed by either deuterium-deuterium fusion or hydrogen-boron fusion for when the lithium runs out. These are not
  easy things to do. The author doubts he will see this in his lifetime, but is open to being pleasantly surprised.

## Why the UK? ##

It's where I live. Just down the road from all that lovely plutonium, as it turns out!

## Shouldn't we just ban nuclear power? ##

Uh-huh...

I disagree, and I suspect if you don't like nuclear power, you probably also don't like wind turbines, solar panels,
hydroelectric dams, pylons, EVs, trains, buses or anything else that isn't just the status quo of burning fossil fuels
and burying your head in the sand.

The thing is, even if you secretly adore fossil fuels (let's be honest, most people do deep down, 'green' rhetoric
notwithstanding), the world is going to run out of fossil fuels; we're talking about within a century. **You**
may not experience their demise, but your *children and grandchildren* will.

So even if you insist on denying the effect of increasing carbon dioxide on the atmosphere, or think that carbon-capture
or geo-engineering via sulphur dioxide will allow us to conduct business as usual, we're going to have to do something
to keep the lights on.

Waiting until the end of fossil fuels isn't a great time to start doing the research-and-development on alternative
energy supplies. Setting stuff up requires a working technological infrastructure, one that consumes a lot of power. You
can't start a fusion reactor with a team of heavy horses. You can't extract rare earths with burning cow-pat.

Still avid about banning nuclear? OK, let's have it your way - what do you intend to do about all that plutonium then?
Just saying that it's banned won't make it disappear. *Naughty plutonium, begone! Get thee behind me, spent nuclear
fuel!* This thing called chemistry is based on the fact that atomic nuclei hang around, despite both biological and
artificial means of recombining these nuclei in inventive ways to make new substances. We can hide our plutonium nuclei
in ceramic plutonium dioxide, or as an insoluble mineral plutonium trifluoride, or dissolve it as plutonium nitrate, or
even make an alloy out of it with gallium, but it's still there.

So it just sits around above ground, gathering dust - and requires a lot of money to look after it and stop
unwholesome people from getting their hands on it.

Ironically, if you hate plutonium, the best way to get rid of it is to fission it - that really does change those pesky
atomic nuclei. You get some electrical power into the bargain too. Quite a lot of it.

## The Pipe-dream ##

First things first - this is just a fanciful idea right now. What I'm interested in is finding out whether the goals
above could be achieved from a physics standpoint. I'm not about to roll up my sleeves and build something in my
backyard.

So let's set out the store...

- We have a reactor, because that's where plutonium gets fissioned (or just plain 'burnt' if we're being less formal
  about terminology), and that's what gives us electrical power.
- We have a fuel cycle, because we want to do something with the existing spent nuclear fuel from the current UK nuclear
  power plant fleet, as well as new stuff that is being built (the EPR reactors) and I hope will be built (the SMR
  reactors).
- We also have the fuel cycle because we need to do something with the stuff going through our special reactor being
  discussed here.
- We have a geological disposal facility because ultimately we have to do something with the genuine nuclear waste
  that comes out of the fuel cycle.

## Some background information ##

Now, when I say *'genuine nuclear waste'*, I don't mean the spent nuclear fuel coming out of the existing reactor fleet,
or our special reactor. I mean the fission products that result from the reactors doing their thing and producing
electricity, as well as some troublemaker elements called the 'minor actinides' that are generated as a byproduct. Also
included is 'fuel cladding', namely the metal sheath that goes around the actual nuclear fuel to hold it together
inside the reactor in the form of a fuel rod, keeping it isolated from the external environment. There are also various
structural bits of metal used to tie the fuel rods together into what is called an 'assembly'.

So spent nuclear fuel is in reality an entire assembly, containing the actual nuclear fuel, the cladding and the
structural bits. An awful lot of that is potentially recyclable into a new generation of assemblies that can go back
into a reactor. However, that isn't done these days in the UK - we just store the used assemblies above ground in secure
buildings, or sometimes leave them hanging around in old reactors.

The fission products contribute a few percent of the spent fuel's mass - typically around 3 to 5% of the mass of
uranium used to make the fresh lot of fuel. Very little uranium actually gets fissioned in most reactors!

The minor actinides come in at around less than 1% of that mass of uranium.

There's roughly a percent of plutonium too.

So more than 90% of the original uranium can be recycled.

The cladding and structural bits contribute very roughly about a quarter of the mass of the entire fuel assembly.

It depends on the kind of cladding used, but in many cases it too could be recycled - but that isn't happening anywhere
right now. The structural bits aren't recyclable at all.

The thing to bear in mind here is that by recycling the uranium and plutonium, as well as the cladding where possible,
we can avoid putting so much stuff into a geological repository.

I mentioned above that 'Very little uranium actually gets fissioned'. This is down to two concerns, the first is that
there is a technological limit as to how long a fuel rod can stay in use within a reactor. The cladding and structural
materials suffer a very slow process of wearing out due to the irradiation and heat inside the reactor, and so does the
fuel itself to a lesser extent. Rather than take it to the absolute limit, the utilities play it safe and limit the
exposure (or 'burnup' in the jargon) of the fuel rods. So more uranium and plutonium could be burnt, but isn't to keep
things safe.

The second concern is that in order to get a nuclear reactor going, there needs to be a concentration of 'fissile'
isotopes in the fuel. All uranium can be fissioned one way or another, but to keep the process going, there needs to be
more than a minimal fraction of the fissile isotopes. These can be U-235, which occurs naturally in mined uranium, or
Pu-239 or Pu-241, which are completely synthetic. There is also U-233 as well, and that is also completely synthetic.

The uranium mined out of the Earth only contains a trifling 0.7% by mass of U-235; the rest is U-238, and you can't
*start* a reactor with that, although you can burn it a little bit once the reactor gets going. So a lot of mined
uranium is run through an 'enrichment plant' to yield a small amount of enriched uranium with around 3% to 5% U-235,
plus a whopping pile of 'depleted uranium' that is almost entirely U-238. That small amount of enriched uranium becomes
fresh nuclear fuel, and the whopping pile of depleted uranium, um ... sits around gathering dust.

Now, depleted uranium is pretty harmless stuff, but it's currently the end of the line, essentially it's a glorified
spoil heap.

It is hard work getting the enrichment all the way from 0.7% up to a measly 5%, so most of the time enrichment stops
there - and that's why burn-up is limited; once the U-235 concentration gets to around 1%, there just isn't enough of
the vital ingredient to keep the reactor going. What's more, once the enrichment in U-235 goes above 20%, this is taken
to be an indication that someone is trying to go for higher enrichment to build a nuclear weapon, and this is considered
to be a Bad Thing.

Recycling spent nuclear fuel (in the jargon, 'reprocessing') can help address these two concerns.

The first is circumvented because the recycled fuel is reconstituted anew with fresh cladding - so it is ready for more
punishment in the reactor.

The second is circumvented because while the U-235 (and some of the U-238) is being fissioned, some more of the U-238 is
transformed in the fuel rod into Pu-239 - and that is fissile. Because the U-238 gives rise to fissile Pu-239, it is
termed 'fertile' and the process is called 'breeding'. This is a good thing, because some of that Pu-239 also
fissions and that increases the burn-up time for a fuel rod, so we get power for a longer period for free.

Now, in a perfect world, reprocessing would allow the remaining dregs of the U-235 to join forces with the Pu-239 bred
in the reactor that hasn't yet been burnt, and that would result in enough fissile concentration to start up a reactor,
so we could keep going for quite a few cycles before all the majority U-238 is either fissioned or converted into
Pu-239.

The catch is that breeding isn't very effective - so for every 100 U-235 nuclei that are fissioned, it turns out around
only 60 to 80 new nuclei of Pu-239 are born from U-238, it depends on the reactor type. Some of these Pu-239 nuclei are
in turn fissioned, so by the time a spent fuel rod comes out of a reactor, it's down to around 1% U-235 and around 1%
Pu. That will only allow a single extra go around in the reactor, and a short one at that.

## Enter the breeder reactor ##

I'm not going into detail here, but it is possible (and it has been done) to build a reactor that can create as much
Pu-239 as it is consumes in fissile nuclei. The idea is to burn Pu-239 as the fissile material in fuel rods, and do the
breeding in a separate volume of U-238 called a 'breeding blanket', away from the 'core' where the power is generated.
The core fuel rods are a mix of depleted uranium (so just U-238) and plutonium (a mix of Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241 and
Pu-242 - don't ask why, it's complicated). The blanket is just depleted uranium.

This requires a much higher level of fissile enrichment in the core, say around 20% (can be lower or higher, it
depends). It also means that reprocessing has to be tweaked, so that the plutonium being bred in the blanket is
transferred into the next cycle's core along with all the plutonium from the previous cycle's core). Essentially, each
lot of reprocessing sucks up the plutonium bred in the blanket and adds it to the stash of the next cycle's core,
keeping the enrichment high enough to restart the reactor.

This is fantastic news, because we don't have to mine every last bit of uranium to get at those precious U-235 nuclei
via enrichment. Instead, we can take that pile of depleted uranium spoil from the enrichment people and put it into the
breeding blanket, and keep our breeder reactor going for a long time.

About 1000 years, give or take.

## Purex ##

Naturally, there's a new catch to this marvellous scheme - and that is in the detail 'reprocessing sucks up the
plutonium bred in the blanket'. The implication is that plutonium has to be *separated* from the remaining U-238 via a
chemical process called 'Purex'; that makes some folk uneasy, because that means we have something that is very enriched
in Pu-239 and Pu-241, both of which are fissile, and that makes us think of nuclear weapons again.

A bit more on Purex - this was done in the US and the UK, but abandoned in the US in the 1970s because of those uneasy
feelings, and abandoned in the UK because natural gas was hitting its stride in the 1980s, which led to the government
pulling the plug on breeder reactor development, eventually leading to the final termination of the last Purex
reprocessing plant in the UK in 2022. We're past peak natural gas production in the North Sea fields, so that decision
doesn't seem quite such a good idea these days.

France continues to use Purex, but they put their plutonium back into ordinary reactors for one or two more cycles.
After these, the plutonium is considered to be junk and can't be reused in an ordinary reactor - although it *could* go
into a breeder reactor, so it's a limited, stop-gap form of recycling (it's down to those non-fissile isotopes of
plutonium, Pu-240 and Pu-242 - again, don't ask, it's a long story).

Other countries are also building and experimenting with their own new breeder reactors and Purex plants.
