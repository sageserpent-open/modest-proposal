# modest-proposal

A *slow* burning muse about nuclear power generation.

## Goals ##

- Find a way that nuclear power generation can make a *sustainable* contribution to the UK's projected electricity
  demand.
- Minimise the demands on long term geological storage of nuclear waste products.
- Make it impossible to subvert or hijack resources for weapon use.
- Do something useful about the roughly 113 tonnes of separated plutonium sitting around the UK.
- Do something useful about the roughly 6000 tonnes of actinides sitting around the UK in the form of spent nuclear
  fuel, not to mention another 1000 tonnes coming our way from current activities.
- Learn a few things in the process.

## Sustainable? ##

- Well, not forever, but please bear in mind that renewable power technologies such as wind, solar or hydroelectric
  power rely ultimately on the Sun's nuclear fusion process; the Sun will eventually go nova and fizzle out.
- So, for at least 1000 years. Long enough for someone to build *a workable power plant* using deuterium-tritium fusion,
  followed by either deuterium-deuterium fusion or hydrogen-boron fusion for when the lithium runs out. These are not
  easy things to do! The author doubts he will see this in his lifetime, but is open to being pleasantly surprised.

## Why the UK? ##

It's where I live. Just down the road from all that lovely plutonium, as it turns out!

## Shouldn't we just ban nuclear power? ##

Uh-huh...

I disagree, and I suspect if you don't like nuclear power, you probably also don't like fracking, wind turbines,
solar panels, hydroelectric dams, pylons, EVs, trains, buses or anything else that isn't just the status quo of burning
fossil fuels and burying your head in the sand.

The thing is, even if you secretly adore fossil fuels (let's be honest, most people do deep down, 'green' rhetoric
notwithstanding), the world is going to run out of fossil fuels, and we're talking about within a century. **You**
may not experience their demise, but your *children and grandchildren* will.

So even if you insist on denying the effect of increasing carbon dioxide on the atmosphere, or think that carbon-capture
or geo-engineering via sulphur dioxide will allow us to conduct business as usual, we're going to have to do something
to keep the lights on.

Waiting until the end of fossil fuels isn't a great time to start doing the research-and-development on alternative
energy supplies. Setting stuff up requires a working technological infrastructure, one that consumes a lot of power. You
can't start a fusion reactor with a team of heavy horses. You can't extract rare earths with burning cow-pat.

Still raving about banning nuclear? OK, let's have it your way - what do you intend to do about all that plutonium then?
Just saying that it's banned won't make it disappear. *Naughty plutonium, begone! Get thee behind me, spent nuclear
fuel!* Nope, there is a thing called chemistry that is based on the fact that atomic nuclei hang around, despite both
biology and artificial means of recombining these nuclei in inventive ways to make new substances.

So it's just sitting around above ground, gathering dust - and requiring a lot of money to look after it and stop
unwholesome people from getting their hands on it.

Ironically, if you hate plutonium, the best way to get rid of it is to fission it - that really does change those pesky
atomic nuclei. You get some electrical power into the bargain too. Quite a lot of it.
